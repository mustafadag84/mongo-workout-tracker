# mongo-workouttracker
# Description

In this assignment, I created a workout tracker. This assignment required to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## Usage

* As a user, you want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. You want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. You should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, you should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
